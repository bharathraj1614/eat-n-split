Bill-Splitting App (React Project)
This project is part of my journey to learning React, where I explored key concepts like state management (useState), component-based architecture, and handling dynamic user interactions.

Key Features:
✅ Add Friends: Users can add friends with a name and profile picture.
✅ Track Balances: See who owes whom, with clear balance updates.
✅ Split Bills Easily: Enter a bill amount, specify contributions, and update balances dynamically.
✅ Interactive UI: Simple and user-friendly design with intuitive interactions.

Tech Stack & Learning Takeaways:
🚀 React & Hooks: Gained hands-on experience with useState for managing app state.
🎨 JSX & CSS: Improved skills in component styling and structuring a React UI.
🛠️ Event Handling: Worked with form inputs, button clicks, and real-time updates.

This project helped me solidify my understanding of React fundamentals and how to build dynamic, interactive apps. Excited to keep learning and improving!# Getting Started with Create React App.

##########
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
